:::tip

Organisations within Flagsmith can be locked to a single authentication method if required, meaning that accounts can
neither be created or logged into with anything other than the method specified. This can be configured at an
Organisation level by a Super-Administrator. Please get in touch if you need help with this.

SAML authentication is only available as part of our Enterprise Plans. Please
[get in touch](https://flagsmith.com/contact-us/) if this is something you are interested in!

## Prerequisites

### Enterprise Self Hosted

To configure the SAML integration with Flagsmith self hosted, you must be using an Enterprise licence to self host the
Flagsmith application. You should then complete the steps listed here up to and including the line which states ‘_Once
you've completed these fields, hit the Save button to create the SAML configuration._’

## Procedure

To allow an Organisation on the Flagsmith platform to login using SAML authentication, you'll need to access the admin
interface. Instructions on how to access the admin interface can be found
[here](/deployment/configuration/django-admin).

Once you've logged into the django admin interface, you'll need to click on the 'Saml Configurations' option in the menu
on the left. From here, you should see a list of existing SAML configuration entities. To create a new one, click on the
'ADD SAML CONFIGURATION' button in the top right corner of the screen.

You should see a screen similar to the following.

From the drop down next to **Organisation**, select the organisation in the Flagsmith platform that you want to
configure for SAML authentication.

Next to **Organisation name**, add a name without any spaces that identifies the organisation uniquely for the
installation of Flagsmith you're working on. This is what users will provide when authenticating with SAML so that the
platform knows where to redirect them.

Next to **Frontend url**, add in the URL at which your Frontend application is running. This is where users will be
redirected to on a successful SAML authentication.

For now, we'll leave **Idp metadata xml** empty.

If you require the ability to initiate authentication requests from your IdP (IdP initiated), you'll need to check the
box next to **Allow IdP-initiated (unsolicited) login**.

Once you've completed these fields, hit the **Save** button to create the SAML configuration.

Now, we need to grab the Flagsmith service provider metadata to configure the integration on your IDP. To do this, open
a new browser tab and head to `https://<your Flagsmith API>/api/v1/auth/saml/<organisation_name>/metadata/` where
`<organisation_name>` is the name you provided above. From here, copy and paste what you see in the web page into a new
text file and save that file as `flagsmith-sp-metadata.xml` or similar.

Note: do not use 'save page as' from your browser as this will likely result in the metadata being incorrect and the
integration will not work.

Now you can use this XML metadata to create the integration on your IDP. Once created on the IDP, you can add the IDP
metadata into the **Idp metadata xml** field that we left blank earlier.

## Attribute Mapping information

To uniquely identify users, we attempt to retrieve a unique identifier from either the `subject-id` or `uid` claim, or
we use the content of the `NameID` attribute.

We also map the following Flagsmith user attributes to the following claims in the SAML response.

| Flagsmith Attribute | IdP claims                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `email`             | `mail`, `email` or `emailAddress`                      |
| `first_name`        | `gn`, `givenName` or (the first part of) `displayName` |
| `last_name`         | `sn`, `surname` or (the second part of) `displayName`  |

Here's an example configuration from Google's SAML app creation flow.

## Group Sync

You can also [configure Flagsmith to add or remove a user from a group](/system-administration/saml.md#group-sync).
